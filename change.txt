Change log

06-April-2004
* Change the item, organization and manifest functions to properly use tree_sortkey (using proper context_id as parent_ids). 

07-April-2004
* Added a link to the items on course-structure, so one can access directly the resource. 

  - Better integration with file_storage,

* Fixed the manifest_title to get rid of path-like / so it can confuse the index.vhu
* Changed the config.tcl file to:

  ns_section ns/server/${server}/module/nssock
  ns_param   timeout            240     ;# increase the timeout to 4 minutes instead
  ns_param   maxinput           5000000 ;# increase the size of the upload files

* If not title is provided in the <item> we add a new one: "[No Title]" ;-) 

09-April-2004

* Added delivery module on /package/lorsm/www/delivery

10-April-2004

* course-add-3.tcl added double support for found_file variable. If more than one file_id is coming back, we check against the actual file directory we added the file from. 
* .LRNized it!! ;-)

11-April-2004

* Resources aren't children of item_ids. They are children of the organizations. [I'm not so sure if this is a 100% correct, but it is better than it was before.
* Added index to lors_imscp_create.sql (following DonB advice).
* Multiplicity of resources per item. We created a new table ims_cp_items_to_resources. Each resource can have one to many items.
* Added index on ims_cp_resources (identifier). I'm not terribly convinced about this. Need to continue exploring this option.

12-April-2004

* Nuked the lors::imscp::findfile function. Changed it instead for lors::findmanifest, as there's no point of searching for manifest files that aren't in the root directory
* Fixed the multiple organizations issues and relations to resources
* Resources now are manifest's children (insted of organization's)
* Tested all IMS packages and they worked like a charm ;-) Except submanifests and empty organization packages.
* Added some bits of documentation to lors-imscp-proc.tcl & lors-imsmd-proc.tcl



Remaining fixes:

Urgent:

[FIXED!] * multiplicity of resources per item (that is critical) [11-April-2004]
[FIXED!] * Resources shouldn't necesarily be linked to organizations as they should be to manifests. They are a subchild of man_id, not org_id! We should be able to add resources without having to have organizations. [12-April-2004]


Important

* tree_sortkey for submanifests (and even maybe files)
* multiple courses in .LRN portlet

Wish list:
* metadata upload LOM XML files for each resource (manifest, file, resource, etc)
